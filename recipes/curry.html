        <h1>Paneer Butter Masala Curry</h1>
        <img src="../img/butter-paneer.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Image showing a bowl of paneer butter masala">
        <p>This is my personal recipe for butter paneer masala, a flavorful and spicy curry. This is a pretty simple dish to make requiring little time and only a few utensils.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
            <li>0.5 tablespoon of minced ginger</li>
            <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 block of paneer cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups basmati or jasmine rice</li>
            <li>Naan of your choosing</li>
            <li>Spices: <ul>
                            <li>Garam masala</li>
                            <li>Turmeric</li>
                            <li>Curry Powder</li>
                            <li>Cumin</li>
                            <li>Paprika</li>
                            <li>Chili Powder</li>
                            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                            <li>Onion Powder</li>
                        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a medium sized raised skillet or pot onto medium heat. The pot needs to be big enough for all the ingredients, so keep this in mind!</li>
            <li>Throw the onion, garlic, and ginger in the skillet with some oil and cook until a golden brown color. Season with the spices. For the seasoning, the amounts are up to you. More just means more heat, so start with a conservative amount if you are worried.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, drain the can of diced tomatoes and throw them in the skillet with the other vegetables. Re-season.</li>
            <li>While the vegetables cook on the stove, start the rice. It will be eaten on the side with the curry, so this step can be done whenever.</li>
            <li>When the tomatoes are soft and tender, transfer the contents to a blender. Blend the vegetables until it is like a paste then put it back on the skillet. Slowly whisk in the heavy whipping cream.</li>
            <li>Once the curry is warm and bubbling some, put the paneer in the curry. You can have some variation with this step. I personally cube the paneer and keep them at about 1 by 1 inch cubes, but it is up to you.</li>
            <li>Serve the curry with rice and naan and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
